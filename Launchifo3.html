        <p>ISRO chairman S Somanath announced on Tuesday that the Venus mission, often informally referred to as Shukrayaan-1, is making progress.</p>
       
            <p>A little over a month after achieving a historic milestone with the successful soft landing of Chandrayaan 3 on the Moon's south pole, and then launching the nation’s first solar mission Aditya-L1, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has shifted its focus to Venus. ISRO chairman S Somanath announced on Tuesday that the Venus mission, often informally referred to as Shukrayaan-1, is making progress. The mission has been configured, and several payloads are currently in the development phase.</p>
            <p>“Venus is a very interesting planet. It also has an atmosphere. Its atmosphere is so thick. The atmospheric pressure is 100 times that of Earth and it is full of acids… Earth could be one day Venus. I don’t know. Maybe 10,000 years later we (Earth) change our characteristics. Earth was never like this. It was not a habitable place long long back,” Somanath said.</p>
